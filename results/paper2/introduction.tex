\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{3D marine ecological models...}

\begin{itemize}
  \item marine ecology models represent biogeochemical interactions as
differential equations.
  \item Can be as minimal as NPZ or as complete as NPZ
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{...are useful because...}

\begin{itemize}
  \item HAB affect public health, desalination and coastal economy
  \item predicting chlorophyll can help fisheries
  \item For research: better understand the large-scale ecosystem
  \item Especially usefull because we lack data about the subsurface
phenomena
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{...But expensive and difficult to run}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \citep{Anderson2005} lot of underdetermination
  \item circulation model very expensive, because very small grid
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{In this article we look at ways to simulate 3D ecosystems more
cheaply by running many parallel 1D regional models}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Divide the Red sea in small regions with similar ecology
  \item Reduces underdetermination
  \item Ensure parametrization is better for each region
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{We are going to test that idea on the Red Sea because...}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Red Sea is an interesting environment: extreme temperatures and
salinity
  \item Very rich and preserved ecosystem
  \item Unexplored environment
  \item Lack of data: therefore developing models is important
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{We will use the hybrid-SEIK data assimilation scheme, because...}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Assimilation constrains the model and reduces underdetermination
  \item Mitigates the fact that initial conditions are unknown
  \item SEIK is better than SEEK for strongly nonlinear models
  \item SEIK is better than EnKF when fewer observations than states
  \item hybridization reduces the ensemble size and the computational cost
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{We will assimilate Chl data even if it is imperfect because it is
the best available data for the Red Sea}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Chl data allows to observe large scale ecological patterns with
high spatial and temporal coverage.
  \item Compared with in situ data that are limited in time and space,
and expensive.
  \item However chl data suffers from missing values due clouds, aerosols, etc.
  \item Also bad values near the coast, case II waters
  \item Both problem particularly affect the southern Red Sea, that has
nearly no observation in the summer during some months.
  \item However as lack of in situ data, this is the best we have
currently in the Red Sea
\end{itemize}

% 
% \paragraph{What are marine ecosystem models}
% ERSEM, NPZ.
% 
% \paragraph{Marine ecosystem models have scientific and practical applications}
% Forecasting, harmful algae blooms, scientific inquiry when not enough data.
% 
% \paragraph{Complex 3D ecological models have limitations}
% Indetermination and computational cost.
% 
% \paragraph{Assimilation in necessary but increases the computational cost}
% Ecological systems are chaotic system that require assimilation to
% maintain a good prediction skill. But assimilation increases the computational
% cost. Assimilation of eco models remains a challenge.
% 
% \paragraph{The hybrid-SEIK}
% Has never been use for eco models before.
% 
% \paragraph{Ocean colour data has been assimilated a lot to eco models}
% chlorophyll is a green colored pigment critical for photosynthesis and found
% in plants and algae \citep{Pal2014}. Give a detectable green coloration
% to the water when phytoplankton is present \citep{Robinson2010}.
% Remotely sensed ocean colour data give highly available data with 
% high coverage both in time and space \citep{Robinson2010}. Ocean colour
% data products like chl are very good proxy for phytoplankton concentration.
% 
% \paragraph{But has some limitations}
% CHL dataset have missing data because of clouds. Which is a big problem in 
% the southern Red Sea in summer where the coverage is almost zero
% \cite{Racault}. Moreover the chl is difficult to estimate in case II
% optically complex waters, especially near the caosts. It also particularly
% affects the southern Red Sea which is very shallow.
% 
% \paragraph{The Red Sea is a relatively unexplored sea}
% Not a lot of studies, not a lot of in situ data.
% Must use models and remotely-sensed data.
% RS is TTS with strong stratification that limits vertical diffusion of nutrients.
% \citep{Mann2006}.
% Other than the gulf of Aden \citep{Yao2015}, 
% the RS has no known significant input of nutrients and
% is oligotrophic \citep{Raitsos2013, Weikert1987}.
% Red Sea has a rich ecosystem and unique ecosystem that has adapted its
% extreme environment \citep{Raitsos2011}.
% RS relatively well preserved but increasingly fragilized by human activities.
% Sharp increase of temperature in the past decade threatend the RS environment.
% \citep{Raitsos2011}.
% 
% \paragraph{Major biological patterns}
% Current hypotheses about primary production in Red Sea.
% There is a lack of missing data therefore the large scale ecological 
% dynamics is poorly known \citep{Raitsos2013, Triantafyllou2014}.
% The role of aerosol deposition could be important but has not been investigated
% yet \citep{Raitsos2013}.
% Eddies are believed to play important role \citep{Raitsos2013, Zhan2014}.
% Chlorophyll increase from north to south \citep{Raitsos2013}.
% Secondary summer bloom (but not in NRS) \citep{Raitsos2013}.
% Strong Interannual variability \citep{Raitsos2013}.
% Exchange of water with GOA is a major driver of productivity for the 
% whole Red Sea \citep{Triantafyllou2014}.
% SRS winter bloom attributed to wind-driven intrusion \citep{Raitsos2013}.
% Deep convection in winter plays a big role in the northern Red Sea
% \citep{Raitsos2013}.
% Red Sea circulation impacted by eddies that could impact productivity
% \citep{Zhai2013}. Central red Sea anti cyclonic eddy is believed to
% control June peak \citep{Raitsos2013}.
% Climate mode indices have impact ton the Red Sea \citep{Raitsos2015}.
% 
% 
% \paragraph{Objective:}
% 3D ecological models are expensive to run. Can we divide the Red Sea into
% regions and have 1D models running in each of them in parallel?
% In this article we cluster the Red Sea in 3 different eco-regions using
% automatic unsupervised learning algorithms. We then run an assimilative 1D
% ecological model on each of the region and analyze the results.
