\section{Results}

\subsection{Model evaluation}

Here, we compare the results of the free-run with the assimilated-run.
We show that we have a good prediction skill, and that the assimilation
improves the model.

\paragraph{Plot some models output vs the data and qualitative comments}

\paragraph{Discuss different metrics to evaluate model and DA schemes}

\paragraph{Show a couple metrics on our results}

\subsection{Analysis}

Here we look at the results and interpret them biologycally. Do we find
comparable results as Acker, Raitsos, Weiker, etc. What can we say about the
hypothesis that they made about he process that drive primary productivity in
the Red Sea.

\paragraph{Discuss differences between climatology and 2003-2004}

\paragraph{Comment on the role of overturning and stratification}

\paragraph{What is the limiting nutrient?}

$$\frac{N3N + N4N}{N1P}$$
vs Redfied ratio

\paragraph{Compute production at different time of years and compare
with Weikert1987/Acker2008/Koblentz}

\paragraph{Study the DCM}
