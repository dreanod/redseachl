\section{Results}

\subsection{Model evaluation}

Here, we compare the results of the free-run with the assimilated-run.
We show that we have a good prediction skill, and that the assimilation
improves the model.

\subsection{Analysis}

Here we look at the results and interpret them biologycally. Do we find
comparable results as Acker, Raitsos, Weiker, etc. What can we say about the
hypothesis that they made about he process that drive primary productivity in
the Red Sea.
