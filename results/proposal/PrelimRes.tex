\section{The Problem is the dataset can be handled}

\begin{itemize}
\item CHL Outliers can be removed
\item Data can be filled with DINEOF
\item Data can be aligned and aggregated
\end{itemize}

\section{The Red Sea can be divided into regions with very different dynamics}

\begin{itemize}
\item North/South mean
\item North/Souch difference in seasonality 
\item Blooms are localized
\end{itemize}

\section{There is enough correlation in the dataset to build predictive models}

\begin{itemize}
\item Correlation study between CHL and individual predictors
\item Percentage of variance explained in CHL
\item Estimating the Bayes Factor (Nearest-neighbor)
\end{itemize}

\section{Geostatistical methods can used for forecast}

\begin{itemize}
\item Demonstrated in Paper 1
\end{itemize}
