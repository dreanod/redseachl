\section{Data Loading}

Most of the data necessary for the analysis has been gathered. Almost all of it is freely available on Internet. Shell and R scripts have been written and used for loading the following data all the data excepted the wind. The latter has been provided by Yesubabu Viswanadhapalli, and is the result of the assimilation of QuickScat satellite and in situ data to the WRF regional wind model. There are additional datasets that could be interesting to use in the analysis, but they are mainly climate mode time-series like IMI and EAWR, that are easy to download. More details about the data can be found in table xxx in the appendice.

So far, the MODIS and CCI data have been cropped over the region of interest, cleaned and exported to the format TIFF, which can be read easily by most software, R in particular. Each of these variables has then been aggregated in a single file in the native R raster format. Applying this processing to the remaining raster data should be straightforward. Then, the data will need to be aligned and aggregated on the same temporal and spatial resolution, before aggregating it in table format.

\section{Red Sea Chlorophyll Data Exploration}

The MODIS and CCI chlorophyll data products have been explored and compared. The MODIS data presents an important amount of missing data that can reach 100\% during summer in the southern Red Sea, making any analysis in this region very difficult. The CCI data product solve this issue by merging three sources of remotely-sensed chlorophyll data (MODIS, MERIS and SeaWiFS) and using a new algorithm for retrieving chlorophyll values when the cloud cover is important. The increases the coverage to 70\% during summer month.

In a previous study (in appendice), the SeaWiFS chlorophyll data has been used. The seasonal signal is the data is strong and has been shown to account for 50\% of the variability. The seasonal anomalies display a strong spatio temporal correlation: the anomlaly at the same location from one week to the other is correlated at 40\%, whereas two locations at 0.5 degrees apart are nearly 60\% correlated. Not shown in this article, I also compared the SST and chlorophyll data, and found an important negative correlation. However, when looking at the anomalies, the correlation disappeared, suggesting that the causes of seasonal and interannual variability are distinct.
