   abstract = {The Red Sea holds one of the most diverse marine ecosystems, primarily due to coral reefs. However, knowledge on large-scale phytoplankton dynamics is limited. Analysis of a 10-year high resolution Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) dataset, along with remotely-sensed sea surface temperature and wind, provided a detailed description of the spatiotemporal seasonal succession of phytoplankton biomass in the Red Sea. Based on MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data, four distinct Red Sea provinces and seasons are suggested, covering the major patterns of surface phytoplankton production. The Red Sea Chl-a depicts a distinct seasonality with maximum concentrations seen during the winter time (attributed to vertical mixing in the north and wind-induced horizontal intrusion of nutrient-rich water in the south), and minimum concentrations during the summer (associated with strong seasonal stratification). The initiation of the seasonal succession occurs in autumn and lasts until early spring. However, weekly Chl-a seasonal succession data revealed that during the month of June, consistent anti-cyclonic eddies transfer nutrients and/or Chl-a to the open waters of the central Red Sea. This phenomenon occurs during the stratified nutrient depleted season, and thus could provide an important source of nutrients to the open waters. Remotely-sensed synoptic observations highlight that Chl-a does not increase regularly from north to south as previously thought. The Northern part of the Central Red Sea province appears to be the most oligotrophic area (opposed to southern and northern domains). This is likely due to the absence of strong mixing, which is apparent at the northern end of the Red Sea, and low nutrient intrusion in comparison with the southern end. Although the Red Sea is considered an oligotrophic sea, sporadic blooms occur that reach mesotrophic levels. The water temperature and the prevailing winds control the nutrient concentrations within the euphotic zone and enable the horizontal transportation of nutrients.},

The results from an annual simulation under climatological forcing are presented. Simulation results are in good agreement with satellite and in situ data illustrating the role of the physical processes in determining the evolution and variability of the Red Sea ecosystem. The model was able to reproduce the main features of the Red Sea ecosystem functioning, including the exchange with the Gulf of Aden, which is a major driving mechanism for the whole Red Sea ecosystem and the winter overturning taking place in the north. Some model limitations, mainly related to the dynamics of the extended reef system located in the southern part of the Red Sea, which is not currently represented in the model, still need to be addressed.},

   volume = {94},
   pages = {S102-S117},
   abstract = {Within the framework of the European INSEA project, an advanced assimilation system has been implemented for the Pagasitikos Gulf ecosystem. The system is based on a multivariate sequential data assimilation scheme that combines satellite ocean sea color (chlorophyll-a) data with the predictions of a three-dimensional coupled physical biochemical model of the Pagasitikos Gulf ecosystem presented in a companion paper. The hydrodynamics are solved with a very high resolution (1/100 degrees) implementation of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM). This model is nested within a coarser resolution model of the Aegean Sea which is part of the Greek POSEIDON forecasting system. The forecast of the Aegean Sea model, itself nested and initialized from a Mediterranean implementation of POM, is also used to periodically re-initalize the Pagatisikos hydrodynamics model using variational initialization techniques. The ecosystem dynamics of Pagasitikos are tackled with a stand-alone implementation of the European Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM). The assimilation scheme is based on the Singular Evolutive Extended Kalman (SEEK) filter, in which the error statistics are parameterized by means of a suitable set of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs).
The assimilation experiments were performed for year 2003 and additionally for a 9-month period over 2006 during which the physical model was forced with the POSEIDON-ETA 6-hour atmospheric fields. The assimilation system is validated by assessing the relevance of the system in fitting the data, the impact of the assimilation on non-observed biochemical processes and the overall quality of the forecasts. Assimilation of either GlobColour in 2003 or SeaWiFS in 2006 chlorophyll-a data enhances the identification of the ecological state of the Pagasitikos Gulf. Results, however, suggest that subsurface ecological observations are needed to improve the controllability of the ecosystem in the deep layers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The skill of assimilation was evaluated with respect to non assimilated in situ data using twelve time series of biogeochemical observations collected weekly at the monitoring station L4. It was found that the assimilation scheme reduced the root mean square error and increased the correlation with the spatial distributions of the assimilated chlorophyll data, with respect to the reference run. More significantly, the skill metrics for non assimilated variables indicate that the hindcast of the mean data values at L4 was improved; however improvements in the short term forecast were not discernable. On the basis of our application, we provide general recommendations for the successful application of ocean color assimilation to hindcast key biogeochemical variables in shelf seas.},

   volume = {127},
   pages = {74-95},
   abstract = {In this paper we evaluate whether the assimilation of remotely-sensed optical data into a marine ecosystem model improves the simulation of biogeochemistry in a shelf sea. A localized Ensemble Kalman filter was used to assimilate weekly diffuse light attenuation coefficient data, K-d(443) from SeaWiFs, into an ecosystem model of the western English Channel. The spatial distributions of (unassimilated) surface chlorophyll from satellite, and a multivariate time series of eighteen biogeochemical and optical variables measured in situ at one long-term monitoring site were used to evaluate the system performance for the year 2006. Assimilation reduced the root mean square error and improved the correlation with the assimilated K-d(443) observations, for both the analysis and, to a lesser extent, the forecast estimates, when compared to the reference model simulation. Improvements in the simulation of (unassimilated) ocean colour chlorophyll were less evident, and in some parts of the Channel the simulation of this data deteriorated. The estimation errors for the (unassimilated) in situ data were reduced for most variables with some exceptions, e.g. dissolved nitrogen. Importantly, the assimilation adjusted the balance of ecosystem processes by shifting the simulated food web towards the microbial loop, thus improving the estimation of some properties, e.g. total particulate carbon. Assimilation of K-d(443) outperformed a comparative chlorophyll assimilation experiment, in both the estimation of ocean colour data and in the simulation of independent in situ data. These results are related to relatively low error in K-d(443) data, and because it is a bulk optical property of marine ecosystems. Assimilation of remotely-sensed optical properties is a promising approach to improve the simulation of biogeochemical and optical variables that are relevant for ecosystem functioning and climate change studies.

   journal = {Ocean Science},
   volume = {9},
   pages = {37-56},
   abstract = {Today, the routine assimilation of satellite data into operational models of ocean circulation is mature enough to enable the production of global reanalyses describing the ocean circulation variability during the past decades. The expansion of the "reanalysis" concept from ocean physics to biogeochemistry is a timely challenge that motivates the present study. The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential benefits of assimilating satellite-estimated chlorophyll data into a basin-scale three-dimensional coupled physical-biogeochemical model of the North Atlantic. The aim is on the one hand to improve forecasts of ocean biogeochemical properties and on the other hand to define a methodology for producing data-driven climatologies based on coupled physical-biogeochemical modeling. A simplified variant of the Kalman filter is used to assimilate ocean color data during a 9-year period. In this frame, two experiments are carried out, with and without anamorphic transformations of the state vector variables. Data assimilation efficiency is assessed with respect to the assimilated data set, nitrate of the World Ocean Atlas database and a derived climatology. Along the simulation period, the non-linear assimilation scheme clearly improves the surface analysis and forecast chlorophyll concentrations, especially in the North Atlantic bloom region. Nitrate concentration forecasts are also improved thanks to the assimilation of ocean color data while this improvement is limited to the upper layer of the water column, in agreement with recent related literature. This feature is explained by the weak correlation taken into account by the assimilation between surface phytoplankton and nitrate concentrations deeper than 50 meters. The assessment of the non-linear assimilation experiments indicates that the proposed methodology provides the skeleton of an assimilative system suitable for reanalyzing the ocean biogeochemistry based on ocean color data.},

The filtering scheme is based on the Singular Evolutive Interpolated Kalman (SEIK) filter which is implemented with a time-local H-infinity filtering strategy to enhance robustness and performances during periods of strong ecosystem variability. Assimilation experiments in the Cretan Sea indicate that robustness can be achieved in the SEIK filter by introducing an adaptive inflation scheme of the modes of the filter error covariance matrix.
Twin-experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the assimilation system and to study the benefits of using robust filtering in an ensemble filtering framework. Pseudo-observations of surface chlorophyll, extracted from a model reference run, were assimilated every two days. Simulation results suggest that the adaptive inflation scheme significantly improves the behavior of the SEIK filter during periods of strong ecosystem variability. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {In this work three versions of the Singular Evolutive Extended Kalman Filter (SEEK) filter are applied to a 1D implementation of a marine ecosystem dynamics model in two locations of the Northern Adriatic Sea to assimilate biogeochemical data. The scope is to gain insight in the benefit of the various levels of error covariance propagation: (1) the forgetting factor version, propagating analysis error correction directions and covariance matrix in reduced space, (2) a simplified version of the former, propagating the covariance matrix in reduced space only and (3) a new version that is proposed in this article abandoning the concept of forgetting factor for a more explicit approach in the approximation of the model noise covariance by statistical means. Twin experiments are presented comparing the various filters along with a free run and a non propagating scheme corresponding to an optimal interpolation to quantify the benefit of these sophisticated, but computationally heavier filters with respect to a simpler approach. The obtained results clearly show that the improvements achieved through the more advanced formulations of the propagation scheme are consistent with the level of sophistication in the design. The results for the filters with full propagation also overcome some unstable behaviour observed for the semi-propagating filter. The filter with statistical treatment of the dynamic noise further improved the results of the version with forgetting factor and full propagation showing a quicker convergence towards the "true solution" in the framework of the twin experiments.

Federal and state coastal administrators have been devising a state-of-the-art monitoring and forecasting system for these HAB events. The efficacy of a monitoring and forecasting system relies on the performance of HAB detection. We propose a machine learning based spatio-temporal data mining approach for the detection of HAB events in the region of the Gulf of Mexico. In this study, a spatio-temporal cubical neighborhood around the training sample is introduced to retrieve relevant spectral information of both HAB and non-HAB classes. The feature relevance is studied through mutual information criterion to understand the important features in classifying HABs from non-HABs. Kernel based support vector machine is used as a classifier in the detection of HABs. This approach gives a significant performance improvement by reducing the false alarm rate. Further, with the achieved classification accuracy, the seasonal variations and sequential occurrence of algal blooms are predicted from spatio-temporal datasets. New variability visualization is introduced to illustrate the dynamic behavior of HABs across space and time.},

   abstract = {Since coastal waters are one of the most vulnerable marine systems to environmental pollution, it is very important to operationally monitor coastal water quality. This study attempts to estimate two major water quality indicators, chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations, in coastal environments on the west coast of South Korea using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite data. Three machine learning approaches including random forest, Cubist, and support vector regression (SVR) were evaluated for coastal water quality estimation. In situ measurements (63 samples) collected during four days in 2011 and 2012 were used as reference data. Due to the limited number of samples, leave-one-out cross validation (CV) was used to assess the performance of the water quality estimation models. Results show that SVR outperformed the other two machine learning approaches, yielding calibration R-2 of 0.91 and CV root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 1.74 mg/m(3) (40.7%) for chl-a, and calibration R-2 of 0.98 and CV RMSE of 11.42 g/m(3) (63.1%) for SPM when using GOCI-derived radiance data. Relative importance of the predictor variables was examined. When GOCI-derived radiance data were used, the ratio of band 2 to band 4 and bands 6 and 5 were the most influential input variables in predicting chl-a and SPM concentrations, respectively. Hourly available GOCI images were useful to discuss spatiotemporal distributions of the water quality parameters with tidal phases in the west coast of Korea.},

   journal = {Remote Sensing of Environment},
   volume = {105},
   pages = {23-33},
   abstract = {In this communication, we evaluate the performance of the relevance vector machine (RVM) for the estimation of biophysical parameters from remote sensing data. For illustration purposes, we focus on the estimation of chlorophyll-a concentrations from remote sensing reflectance just above the ocean surface. A variety of bio-optical algorithms have been developed to relate measurements of ocean radiance to in situ concentrations of phytoplankton pigments, and ultimately most of these algorithms demonstrate the potential of quantifying chlorophyll-a concentrations accurately from multispectral satellite ocean color data. Both satellite-derived data and in situ measurements are subject to high levels of uncertainty. In this context, robust and stable non-linear regression methods that provide inverse models are desirable.
Lately, the use of the support vector regression (SVR) has produced good results in inversion problems, improving state-of-the-art neural networks. However, the SVR has some deficiencies, which could be theoretically alleviated by the RVM. In this paper, performance of the RVM is evaluated in terms of accuracy and bias of the estimations, sparseness of the solutions, robustness to low number of training samples, and computational burden. In addition, some theoretical issues are discussed, such as the sensitivity to training parameters setting, kernel selection, and confidence intervals on the predictions.
Results suggest that RVMs offer an excellent trade-off between accuracy and sparsity of the solution, and become less sensitive to the selection of the free parameters. A novel formulation of the RVM that incorporates prior knowledge of the problem is presented and successfully tested, providing better results than standard RVM formulations, SVRs, neural networks, and classical bio-optical models for SeaWIFS, such as Morel, CalCOFI and OC2/OC4 models.

   title = {Hybrid {ANN-GA} model for predicting turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentrations},
   journal = {Journal of Hydro-Environment Research},
   volume = {7},
   pages = {279-299},
   abstract = {The transport and fate of admixtures at coastal zones are driven, or at least modulated, by currents. In particular, in tide-dominated areas due to higher near-bottom shear stress at strong currents, sediment concentration and turbidity are expected to be at maximum during spring tide, while algal growth rate likely is peaking up at slack currents during neap tide. Varying weather and atmospheric conditions might modulate the said dependencies, but the water quality pattern still is expected to follow the dominant tidal cycle. As tidal cycling could be predicted well ahead, there is a possibility to use water quality and hydrodynamic high-resolution data to learn past dependencies, and then use tidal hydrodynamic model for nowcasting and forecasting of selected water quality parameters.
This paper develops data driven models for nowcasting and forecasting turbidity and chlorophyll-a using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) combined with Genetic Algorithm (GA). The use of GA aims to automate and enhance ANN designing process. The training of the ANN model is done by constructing input-output mapping, where hydrodynamic parameters act as an input for the network, while turbidity and chlorophyll-a are the corresponding outputs (desired target). Afterward, the prediction is carried out only by employing computed water surface elevation as an input for the trained ANN model. The proposed data driven model has successfully revealed complex relationships and utilized its experiential knowledge acquired from the training process for facilitating the subsequent use of the data driven model to yield an accurate prediction.

   title = {Neural network modelling of coastal algal blooms},
   journal = {Ecological Modelling},
   volume = {159},
   pages = {179-201},
   abstract = {An artificial neural network (ANN), a data driven modelling approach, is proposed to predict the algal bloom dynamics of the coastal waters of Hong Kong. The commonly used back-propagation learning algorithm is employed for training the ANN. The modeling is based on (a) comprehensive biweekly water quality data at Tolo Harbour (1982-2000); and (b) 4-year set of weekly phytoplankton abundance data at Lamina Island (1996-2000). Algal biomass is represented as chlorophyll-a and cell concentration of Skeletonema at the two locations, respectively. Analysis of a large number of scenarios shows that the best agreement with observations is obtained by using merely the time-lagged algal dynamics as the network input. In contrast to previous findings with more complicated neural networks of algal blooms in freshwater systems, the present work suggests the algal concentration in the eutrophic sub-tropical coastal water is mainly dependent on the antecedent algal concentrations in the previous 1-2 weeks. This finding is also supported by an interpretation of the neural networks' weights. Through a systematic analysis of network performance, it is shown that previous reports of predictability of algal dynamics by ANN are erroneous in that 'future data' have been used to drive the network prediction. In addition, a novel real time forecast of coastal algal blooms based on weekly data at Lamina is presented. Our study shows that an ANN model with a small number of input variables is able to capture trends of algal dynamics, but data with a minimum sampling interval of 1 week is necessary. However, the sufficiency of the weekly sampling for real time predictions using ANN models needs to be further evaluated against longer weekly data sets as they become available.

   journal = {Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans},
   volume = {119},
   pages = {2263-2289},
   abstract = {The shallow winter overturning circulation in the Red Sea is studied using a 50 year high-resolution MITgcm (MIT general circulation model) simulation with realistic atmospheric forcing. The overturning circulation for a typical year, represented by 1980, and the climatological mean are analyzed using model output to delineate the three-dimensional structure and to investigate the underlying dynamical mechanisms. The horizontal model circulation in the winter of 1980 is dominated by energetic eddies. The climatological model mean results suggest that the surface inflow intensifies in a western boundary current in the southern Red Sea that switches to an eastern boundary current north of 24 degrees N. The overturning is accomplished through a cyclonic recirculation and a cross-basin overturning circulation in the northern Red Sea, with major sinking occurring along a narrow band of width about 20 km along the eastern boundary and weaker upwelling along the western boundary. The northward pressure gradient force, strong vertical mixing, and horizontal mixing near the boundary are the essential dynamical components in the model's winter overturning circulation. The simulated water exchange is not hydraulically controlled in the Strait of Bab el Mandeb; instead, the exchange is limited by bottom and lateral boundary friction and, to a lesser extent, by interfacial friction due to the vertical viscosity at the interface between the inflow and the outflow.

From the results of the study, the effectiveness of ANN over statistical method was proposed. Also feasible direction of increasing ANN models' performance was provided. A hypertrophic river data was used to develop prediction models (chlorophyll a (chl. a) 41.7 +/- 56.8 mu g L-1; n=406). Higher time-series predictability was found from the ANN model. Failure of statistical methods would be due to the complex nature of ecological data in the regulated river ecosystems. Reduction of ANN model size by decreasing the number of input variables according to the sensitivity analysis did not have effectiveness with respect to the predictability on testing data set (RMSE of the ANN with all 27 variables, 25.7; 47.9 from using 2 highly sensitive variables; 42.9 from using 5 sensitive variables; 33.1 from using 1S variables). Even though the ANN model presented high performance in prediction accuracy, more efficient methods of selecting feasible input information are strongly requested for the prediction of freshwater ecological dynamics.

We draw attention to a physical dispersion model which could model phenomena such as the spread of an air pollutant. We show that this model has a non-separable covariance function. The model is well suited to a wide range of realistic problems which will be poorly fitted by separable models. The model operates successively in time: the spatial field at time t + 1 is obtained by 'blurring' the field at time t and adding a spatial random field. The model is first introduced at discrete time steps, and the limit is taken as the length of the time steps goes to 0. This gives a consistent continuous model with parameters that are interpretable in continuous space and independent of sampling intervals. Under certain conditions the blurring must be a Gaussian smoothing kernel. We also show that the model is generated by a stochastic differential equation which has been studied by several researchers previously.},

   title = {Modeling daily chlorophyll a dynamics in a {German} lowland river using artificial neural networks and multiple linear regression approaches},
   journal = {Limnology},
   volume = {15},
   pages = {47-56},
   abstract = {Phytoplankton biomass is an important indicator for water quality, and predicting its dynamics is thus regarded as one of the important issues in the domain of river ecology and management. However, the vast majority of models in river systems have focused mostly on flow prediction and water quality with very few applications to biotic parameters such as chlorophyll a (Chl a). Based on a 1.5-year measured dataset of Chl a and environmental variables, we developed two modeling approaches [artificial neural networks (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR)] to simulate the daily Chl a dynamics in a German lowland river. In general, the developed ANN and MLR models achieved satisfactory accuracy in predicting daily dynamics of Chl a concentrations. Although some peaks and lows were not predicted, the predicted and the observed data matched closely by the MLR model with the coefficient of determination (R (2)), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS), and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.53, 0.53, and 2.75 for the calibration period and 0.63, 0.62, and 1.94 for the validation period, respectively. Likewise, the results of the ANN model also illustrated a good agreement between observed and predicted data during calibration and validation periods, which was demonstrated by R (2), NS, and RMSE values (0.68, 0.68, and 2.27 for the calibration period, 0.55, 0.66 and 2.12 for the validation period, respectively). According to the sensitivity analysis, Chl a concentration was highly sensitive to dissolved inorganic nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, autoregressive Chl a, chloride, sulfate, and total phosphorus. We concluded that it was possible to predict the daily Chl a dynamics in the German lowland river based on relevant environmental factors using either ANN or MLR models. The ANN model is well suited for solving non-linear and complex problems, while the MLR model can explicitly explore the coefficients between independent and dependent variables. Further studies are still needed to improve the accuracy of the developed models.},

   abstract = {Coral reef ecosystems, often referred to as "marine rainforests," concentrate the most diverse life in the oceans. Red Sea reef dwellers are adapted in a very warm environment, fact that makes them vulnerable to further and rapid warming. The detection and understanding of abrupt temperature changes is an important task, as ecosystems have more chances to adapt in a slowly rather than in a rapid changing environment. Using satellite derived sea surface and ground based air temperatures, it is shown that the Red Sea is going through an intense warming initiated in the mid-90s, with evidence for an abrupt increase after 1994 (0.7 degrees C difference pre and post the shift). The air temperature is found to be a key parameter that influences the Red Sea marine temperature. The comparisons with Northern Hemisphere temperatures revealed that the observed warming is part of global climate change trends. The hitherto results also raise additional questions regarding other broader climatic impacts over the area. Citation: Raitsos, D.E., I. Hoteit, P.K. Prihartato, T. Chronis, G. Triantafyllou, and Y.

   abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) caused by the marine ichthyotoxic dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoides Margalef are responsible for mass mortalities of wild and farmed fish worldwide, with catastrophic impacts to aquaculture and local economies. Here we report on the Cochlodinium species responsible for a severe and widespread HAB in the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman that has lasted for more than eight months at this writing, killing thousands of tons of fish and limiting traditional fishery operations, damaging coral reefs, impacting coastal tourism, and forcing the closure of desalination plants in the region. To identify the causative organism, cultures were established from cells isolated along the Arabian Gulf shore of the United Arab Emirates. Taxonomic analyses using scanning and light microscopy, and partial analysis of the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene confirmed the C polykrikoides classification. rRNA gene sequences of C polykrikoides isolates from the Arabian Gulf were identical to isolates from the northeastern USA, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Malaysia, known as the "American/Malaysian" ribotype. To our knowledge, this is the first HAB event associated with C polykrikoides in the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Oman. The sudden emergence of C. polykrikoides in these Gulfs coincides with an apparent global expansion of this taxon, as well as a recent increase in HAB impacts observed in this region. The mechanisms underlying this expansion require further investigation, and may include increased nutrient enrichment of coastal waters in the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman from domestic and industrial inputs, natural meteorological and oceanographic forcings, and the recent introduction of this species through ballast water discharge. A pattern of subsequent recurrence of C. polykrikoides blooms following an initial outbreak has been observed in other parts of the world, suggesting that this species may become a persistent HAB problem in this region. As Arabian Gulf countries rely on desalination plants as the primary source of freshwater, the disruption of plant operations by recurring Cochlodinium blooms poses a serious threat to the drinking water supply in the region, and represents an unprecedented HAB impact.

   pages = {3909-3925},
   abstract = {Sea level anomaly (SLA) data spanning 1992-2012 were analyzed to study the statistical properties of eddies in the Red Sea. An algorithm that identifies winding angles was employed to detect 4998 eddies propagating along 938 unique eddy tracks. Statistics suggest that eddies are generated across the entire Red Sea but that they are prevalent in certain regions. A high number of eddies is found in the central basin between 18 degrees N and 24 degrees N. More than 87% of the detected eddies have a radius ranging from 50 to 135 km. Both the intensity and relative vorticity scale of these eddies decrease as the eddy radii increase. The averaged eddy lifespan is approximately 6 weeks. AEs and cyclonic eddies (CEs) have different deformation features, and those with stronger intensities are less deformed and more circular. Analysis of long-lived eddies suggests that they are likely to appear in the central basin with AEs tending to move northward. In addition, their eddy kinetic energy (EKE) increases gradually throughout their lifespans. The annual cycles of CEs and AEs differ, although both exhibit significant seasonal cycles of intensity with the winter and summer peaks appearing in February and August, respectively. The seasonal cycle of EKE is negatively correlated with stratification but positively correlated with vertical shear of horizontal velocity and eddy growth rate, suggesting that the generation of baroclinic instability is responsible for the activities of eddies in the Red Sea.},

   volume = {118},
   pages = {422-434},
   abstract = {Remote sensing and in situ observations are used to investigate the ocean response to the Tokar Wind Jet in the Red Sea. The wind jet blows down the atmospheric pressure gradient through the Tokar Gap on the Sudanese coast, at about 19 degrees N, during the summer monsoon season. It disturbs the prevailing along-sea (southeastward) winds with strong cross-sea (northeastward) winds that can last from days to weeks and reach amplitudes of 20-25 m/s. By comparing scatterometer winds with along-track and gridded sea level anomaly observations, it is observed that an intense dipolar eddy spins up in response to the wind jet. The eddy pair has a horizontal scale of 140 km. Maximum ocean surface velocities can reach 1 m/s and eddy currents extend more than 100 m into the water column. The eddy currents appear to cover the width of the sea, providing a pathway for rapid transport of marine organisms and other drifting material from one coast to the other. Interannual variability in the strength of the dipole is closely matched with variability in the strength of the wind jet. The dipole is observed to be quasi-stationary, although there is some evidence for slow eastward propagation in an idealized numerical model. Simulation of the dipole in an idealized high-resolution numerical model suggests that this is the result of self-advection. Citation: Zhai, P., and A. S.

   journal = {Journal of Climate},
   volume = {26},

   abstract = {Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is commonly used in the climate sciences and elsewhere to describe, reconstruct, and predict highly dimensional data fields. When data contain a high percentage of missing values (i.e., gappy), alternate approaches must be used in order to correctly derive EOFs. The aims of this paper are to assess the accuracy of several EOF approaches in the reconstruction and prediction of gappy data fields, using the Galapagos Archipelago as a case study example. EOF approaches included least squares estimation via a covariance matrix decomposition [least squares EOF (LSEOF)], data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF), and a novel approach called recursively subtracted empirical orthogonal functions (RSEOF). Model-derived data of historical surface chlorophyll-a concentrations and sea surface temperature, combined with a mask of gaps from historical remote sensing estimates, allowed for the creation of true and observed fields by which to gauge the performance of EOF approaches. Only DINEOF and RSEOF were found to be appropriate for gappy data reconstruction and prediction. DINEOF proved to be the superior approach in terms of accuracy, especially for noisy data with a high estimation error, although RSEOF may be preferred for larger data fields because of its relatively faster computation time.},

   abstract = {The sun glint is a major issue for the observation of ocean color from space. For sensors without a tilting capacity, the observations at sub-tropical latitudes are contaminated by the bright pattern of the specular reflexion of the sun by the wavy sea surface. Common atmospheric correction algorithms are not designed to work in these observation conditions, reducing the spatial coverage at such latitudes by nearly a half. We describe an original atmospheric correction algorithm, named POLYMER, designed to recover ocean color parameters in the whole sun glint pattern. It has been applied to MERIS data, and validated against in-situ data from SIMBADA. The increase of useful coverage of MERIS measurements for ocean color is major, and the accuracy of the retrieved parameters is not significantly reduced in the presence of high sunglint, while, outside the sunglint area, it remains about the same as by using the standard algorithm.

   volume = {119},
   pages = {2238-2262},
   abstract = {The overturning circulation in the Red Sea exhibits a distinct seasonally reversing pattern and is studied using high-resolution MIT general circulation model simulations. In the first part of this study, the vertical and horizontal structure of the summer overturning circulation and its dynamical mechanisms are presented from the model results. The seasonal water exchange in the Strait of Bab el Mandeb is successfully simulated, and the structures of the intruding subsurface Gulf of Aden intermediate water are in good agreement with summer observations in 2011. The model results suggest that the summer overturning circulation is driven by the combined effect of the shoaling of the thermocline in the Gulf of Aden resulting from remote winds in the Arabian Sea and an upward surface slope from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden set up by local surface winds in the Red Sea. In addition, during late summer two processes associated, respectively, with latitudinally differential heating and increased salinity in the southern Red Sea act together to cause the reversal of the contrast of the vertical density structure and the cessation of the summer overturning circulation. Dynamically, the subsurface northward pressure gradient force is mainly balanced by vertical viscosity resulting from the vertical shear and boundary friction in the Strait of Bab el Mandeb. Unlike some previous studies, the three-layer summer exchange flows in the Strait of Bab el Mandeb do not appear to be hydraulically controlled.

However, these filters remain expensive for real operational assimilation. The purpose of this paper is to develop degraded forms of the SEIK filter which are less costly and yet perform reasonably well. Our approach essentially consists in simplifying the evolution of the correction basis of the SEIK filter, which is the most expensive part of this filter. To deal with model instabilities, we also introduce two adaptive tuning schemes to control the correction basis evolution and adjust the variable forgetting factor. Our filters have been implemented in a realistic setting of the OPA model over the tropical pacific zone and their performance studied through twin experiments in which the observations are taken to be synthetic altimeter data sampled on the sea surface. The SEIK filter is used as a reference for comparison. Our new filters perform nearly as well as the SEIK, but can be 2-30 times faster. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This article reviews the past 15 years of developments in regional ocean data assimilation. A variety of scientific, management, and safety-related objectives motivate marine scientists to characterize many ocean environments, including coastal regions. As in weather prediction, the accurate representation of physical, chemical, and/or biological properties in the ocean is challenging. Models and observations alone provide imperfect representations of the ocean state, but together they can offer improved estimates. Variational and sequential methods are among the most widely used in regional ocean systems, and there have been exciting recent advances in ensemble and four-dimensional variational approaches. These techniques are increasingly being tested and adapted for biogeochemical applications.},

   abstract = {Kalman filters are widely used for data assimilation into ocean models. The aim of this study is to discuss the relevance of these filters with high resolution ocean models. This was investigated through the comparison of two advanced Kalman filters: the singular evolutive extended Kalman (SEEK) filter and its ensemble-based variant, called SEIK filter. The two filters were implemented with the Princeton Ocean model (POM) considering a low spatial resolution configuration (Mediterranean sea model) and a very high one (Pagasitikos Gulf coastal model). It is shown that the two filters perform reasonably well when applied with the low resolution model. However, when the high resolution model is considered, the behavior of the SEEK filter seriously degrades because of strong model nonlinearities while the SEIK filter remains remarkably more stable. Based on the assumption of prior Gaussian distributions, the linear analysis step of the latter can still be improved though.},

   journal = {Monthly Weather Review},

   pages = {2905-2919},
   abstract = {A hybrid ensemble Kalman Alter-three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) analysis scheme is demonstrated using a quasigeostrophic model under perfect-model assumptions. Four networks with differing observational densities are rested, including one network with a data void. The hybrid scheme operates by computing a set of parallel data assimilation cycles, with each member of the set receiving unique perturbed observations. The perturbed observations are generated by adding random noise consistent with observation error statistics to the control set of observations. Background error statistics for the data assimilation are estimated from a linear combination of time-invariant 3DVAR covariances and flow-dependent covariances developed from the ensemble of short-range forecasts:. The hybrid scheme allows the user to weight the relative contributions of the 3DVAR and ensemble-based background covariances.
The analysis scheme was cycled for 90 days, with new observations assimilated every 12 h. Generally, it was found that the analysis performs best when background error covariances are estimated almost fully from the ensemble, especially when the ensemble size was large. When small-sized ensembles are used, some lessened weighting of ensemble-based covariances is desirable. The relative improvement over 3DVAR analysts was dependent upon the observational data density and norm; generally, there is less improvement for data-rich networks than for darn-poor networks, with the largest improvement for the network with the data void. As expected, errors depend on the size of the ensemble, with errors decreasing as more ensemble members are added. The sets of initial conditions generated from the hybrid are generally well calibrated and provide an improved set of initial conditions for ensemble forecasts.},

   pages = {2899-2914},
   abstract = {This study evaluates and compares the performances of several variants of the popular ensemble Kalman filter for the assimilation of storm surge data with the advanced circulation (ADCIRC) model. Using meteorological data from Hurricane Ike to force the ADCIRC model on a domain including the Gulf of Mexico coastline, the authors implement and compare the standard stochastic ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and three deterministic square root EnKFs: the singular evolutive interpolated Kalman (SEIK) filter, the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF), and the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF). Covariance inflation and localization are implemented in all of these filters. The results from twin experiments suggest that the square root ensemble filters could lead to very comparable performances with appropriate tuning of inflation and localization, suggesting that practical implementation details are at least as important as the choice of the square root ensemble filter itself. These filters also perform reasonably well with a relatively small ensemble size, whereas the stochastic EnKF requires larger ensemble sizes to provide similar accuracy for forecasts of storm surge.},

   journal = {Tellus},
   volume = {57A},
   number = {5},
   pages = {715-735},
   abstract = {Three advanced filter algorithms based on the Kalman filter are reviewed and presented in a unified notation. They are the well-known ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the singular evolutive extended Kalman (SEEK) filter, and the less common singular evolutive interpolated Kalman (SEIK) filter. For comparison, the mathematical formulations of the filters are reviewed in relation to the extended Kalman filter as error subspace Kalman filters. The algorithms are presented in their original form and possible variations are discussed. A comparison of the algorithms shows their theoretical capabilities for efficient data assimilation with large-scale non-linear systems. In particular, problems of the analysis equations are apparent in the original EnKF algorithm due to the Monte Carlo sampling of ensembles. Theoretically, the SEIK filter appears to be a numerically very efficient algorithm with high potential for use with non-linear models. The superiority of the SEIK filter is demonstrated on the basis of identical twin experiments using a shallow-water model with non-linear evolution. Identical initial conditions for all three filters allow for a consistent comparison of the data assimilation results. These show how choices of particular state ensembles and assimilation schemes lead to significant variations of the filter performance. This is related to different qualities of the predicted error subspaces, as is demonstrated in an examination of the predicted state covariance matrices.},
