\chapter{Research Plan}

The research plan including the different chapters of the thesis is presented
hereafter.  Chapter 1 presents the dataset that will be used in the following
chapters.  In chapter 2, we will divide the Red Sea into eco-regions using
clustering algorithms. Then, we will fit statistical models for forecasting
chlorophyll in these regions. In chapter 3, we will construct a spatio-temporal
geostatistical model for the global Red Sea chlorophyll, and use it for
forecasting. In chapter 4, this geostatistical model will be refined by using
several regional geostatistical models. In chapter 5, chlorophyll will be
forecasted using assimilated 1D regional deterministic ecological models, and
the results will be compared to the statistical models.  Chapter 6, will
develop a method to combine statistical and deterministic models for improving
chlorophyll forecasting in the Red Sea.
