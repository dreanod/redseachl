\chapter{Research Plan}

In this section, we introduce the different chapters of the thesis.  In chapter
1, the dataset used in the following chapters will be constructed and explored.
In chapter 2, we will divide the Red Sea into eco-regions using clustering
algorithms. Then, we will fit statistical models for forecasting chlorophyll in
these regions. In chapter 3, we will construct a spatio-temporal geostatistical
model for the global Red Sea chlorophyll, and use it for forecasting. In
chapter 4, this model will be refined by using several regional geostatistical
models. In chapter 5, we will forecast chlorophyll using assimilated 1D
regional deterministic ecological models and compare it our previous statistical
models.  In chapter 6, we will propose a method to combine statistical and
deterministic models for improving the chlorophyll forecast.
