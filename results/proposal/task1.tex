\section{Chapter 1: Dataset Building and Exploration}

A preliminary task to statistical data modeling is the gathering, cleaning and
exploration of the data. Given the complexity and the size (40 GB) of the
dataset, this is not an simple task. This first data analysis will reveal if
enough data has been gathered to make meaningful forecasts, and what accuracy
we can expect from the models. This chapter will also provide information that
will help in designing statistical models: most significant variables,
differences between regions, relevant data transformation, etc. Finally, this
chapter will identify patterns in the data that will be useful to qualitatively
evaluate predictive models.

\paragraph{Open Questions}

\begin{itemize} 

\item Can we efficiently identify outliers in the chlorophyll values?

\item Is there a way to efficiently fill the missing values in the chlorophyll
dataset?

\item Can the data help understanding the mechanisms behind extreme blooms in
the Red Sea?

\item Will the data support the hypothesizes about the dynamics behind the
chlorophyll seasonal variabilities in the Red Sea?

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Methods}

\begin{enumerate} 

\item Identify data sources and gather the data.

\item Clean the data and fill in missing values (DINEOF).

\item Align and format the data to build a cleaned dataset.

\item Explore the dataset.

\begin{itemize} 

\item Study the correlation between chlorophyll and other variables using,
linear regression, GAM, data transformations, etc.

\item Apply variable selection techniques such as, lasso, single variable
regression, or multistep regression, to reduce the number of variables in the
model.

\item Study the regional aggregation (ACF), to characterize the regional
clusters.

\item Explore spatiotemporal correlations (hovmoller plots, PCA, variograms) to
understand the spatial features of the chlorophyll data.

\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Expected Outcomes}

\begin{itemize} 

\item A cleaned dataset that can be used in the following chapters.

\item A comprehensive exploration of the available data to study chlorophyll
variability in the Red Sea.

\item A preliminary variable selection.

\item A clear picture of the major spatio-temporal patterns in the
chlorophyll data.

\item A critical evaluation of the current hypotheses about the chlorophyll
dynamics in the Red Sea.

\end{itemize}
