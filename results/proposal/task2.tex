\section{Chapter 2: Forecasting Chlorophyll Concentration in Regional
Aggregates}

The complexity of marine ecosystems is reflected by the chlorophyll data.  It
is therefore useful to first simplify it by aggregating it spatially. The
space-time dynamics of the chlorophyll data reflects the highly nonlinear
dynamics of the underlying physical, chemical and biological phenomenons. As
shown by the north-south gradient and the seasonal variabilities of chlorophyll
in the Red Sea, the resulting
space-time process is nonstationary in time and in space. The
high-dimensionality in space can be reduced by considering a regional
aggregation of the data. This would allow us to focus on the global scale
phenomenons: such as the interactions between neighboring regions, the
time-scale of large events and the difference in the physical variables
affecting the chlorophyll concentration in each region.  These simple
predictive models will also be used as a reference for evaluating the more
complex models that will be developed in the following chapters.

\paragraph{Open Questions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Is the biological aggregation of the Red Sea proposed in
\citep{Raitsos2013} statistically meaningful?

\item Can clustering methods be used to identify marine ecological zones based
on chlorophyll data?

\item Would simple statistical models allow us to identify the causes of
chlorophyll blooms and to forecast chlorophyll concentration?

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Methods}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Define the datasets that will be used to train and test the models,
as well as the cross-validation methodology.

\item Apply unsupervised learning algorithms to the dataset to divide
the Red Sea into clusters corresponding to different environmental
conditions.

\item Build regional statistical models to forecast chlorophyll concentration.

\item Evaluate the models for the prediction of extreme blooms.

\end{enumerate}

\end{samepage}

\paragraph{Expected Outcomes}

\begin{itemize}

\item A division of the Red Sea into environmentaly distinct regions that has
been quantitatively evaluated.

\item A critical evaluation of current hypotheses about the chlorophyll
dynamics in the Red Sea.

\item A lower bound for the performance of more sophisticated models.

\item An assessment of the limitation of aggregate methods for Chlorophyll
data.

\item An understanding of how the treatment of spatial correlations may improve
cholorphyll forecasting.

\end{itemize}
