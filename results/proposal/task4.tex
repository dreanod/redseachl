Duration: 3 months (by June 2015)
Submission: Journal of the American Statistical Association (Case Study)
Collaborator: Raphael Huser

\subsection{Motivation}

This part will bring together the results of the two preceding tasks to develop a predictive model that takes into account the large-scale dynamics and the regional spatio-temporal dynamics. In task 2, a predictive model is built, that represents the large scales behaviour of the Red Sea, but the spatial dimension inside each region is not addressed. We expect local features to play a role, such as the proximity to the coast, the bathymetry, proximity to other regions or major cities, etc. In task 3, we developed a methodology to use a geostatistical model in a dynamic fashion to do pixel-scale forecast. In this task, each regions will be modeled separately by a local geostatistical model that can do local prediction. These models will have access to aggregate covariates from neighboring regions in represent the global scale behaviours. 

\subsection{Open Questions}

What are the most adapted space-time covariance models for chlorophyll data?
How to use global covariates in a geostatistical model?
What are the differences in the fine-scale dynamics of chlorophyll in each region?
Can the fine scale behaviour of phytoplankton be predicted accurately?
What are the spatial features that are important for the chlorophyll dynamics?

\subsection{Method}

Extract local dataset from previous tasks
Design the training and test datasets, and the cross-validation method
Design and evaluate the mean function given the past covariates
Fit the local geostatistical model to the residuals.
Evaluate the model predictions and compare the results with task 2 and 3.
Expected Outcomes
A methodology to aggregate local geostatistical models
An improvements in the prediction skills over the models of task 2 and 3.
An understanding of the differences between each regions.
A critical evaluation of the space-time covariance models for fitting chlorophyll data.
A better characterization of the regional chlorophyll dynamics.
