\section{Chapter 4: Local Geostatistical Model for Chlorophyll Forecasting}

This part will bring together the results of the two preceding tasks to develop
a geostatistical model that takes into account the large-scale dynamics and the
regional spatio-temporal dynamics. In task 2, a predictive model is built, that
represents the large scales behaviour of the Red Sea, but the spatial dimension
inside each region is not addressed. We expect local features to play a role,
such as the proximity to the coast, the bathymetry, proximity to other regions
or major cities, etc. In task 3, we proposed a methodology to use a
geostatistical model in a dynamic fashion to do pixel-scale forecast. In this
task, each regions will be modeled separately by a local geostatistical model
that can provide local prediction. These models will have access to aggregate
covariates from neighboring regions to represent the global scale behaviours. 

\paragraph{Open Questions}

\begin{itemize}

\item What are the most adapted space-time covariance models for chlorophyll
data?

\item How to use global covariates in a geostatistical model?

\item What are the differences in the spatio-temporal correlation of
chlorophyll in each region?

\item Can the regional behaviour of phytoplankton be accurately predicted?

\item What are the spatial features that are important for regional chlorophyll
dynamics in the Red Sea?

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Methods}

\begin{itemize}

\item Extract local dataset from previous tasks.

\item Design the training and test datasets, and the cross-validation method.

\item Design and evaluate the mean function given the past covariates.

\item Fit the local geostatistical model to the residuals.

\item Evaluate the model predictions and compare the results with chapters 2
and 3.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Expected Outcomes}

\begin{itemize}

\item A methodology to aggregate local geostatistical models.

\item An improvements in the prediction skills over the models of chapters 2
and 3.

\item An understanding of the differences between the regions that have
been identified in chapter 2.

\item A critical evaluation of the space-time covariance models for fitting
chlorophyll data.

\item A better characterization of the regional chlorophyll dynamics.

\end{itemize}
