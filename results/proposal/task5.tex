\section{Chapter 5: Assimilation of Regional 1D Ecological Models and
Comparison with Statistical Models}

The three previous chapters focus on constructing increasingly sophisticated
statistical models for predicting the chlorophyll concentration in the Red Sea.
In this chapter these models will be evaluated against 1D ecological models
(ERSEM). The goal of this part will be to identify the merits of each modeling
approach, and propose ways in which they can complement each other. 1D
ecological models will be run in each of the regions that have been identified
in Chapter 2.  Available data will also be assimilated into the models using
ensemble Kalman-based filtering and smoothing techniques, which we will further
equip with an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm for parameters
estimation.

\paragraph{Open Questions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Are statistical methods competitive for forecasting chlorophyll
concentrations?

\item How may statistical and deterministic models complement each other?

\item May statistical methods forecast relevant dynamical features?

\item Are there significant regional differences in the relative performances
of both approaches?

\item How best to estimate the parameters of ecological models? 

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Methods}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Implement 1D ERSEM models in each of the identified regions.

\item Select and further develop an assimilation scheme and the data that will
be assimilated into each regional model.

\item Implement the assimilation scheme, and study the predictability of
chlorophyll in the Red Sea.

\item Run the simulation and aggregate the results to allow for comparison with
the statistical models introduced in the previous chapters.

\item Define the metrics for comparison between statistical and deterministic
models.

\item Conduct the comparison with the statistical models and summarize the
results.

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Expected Outcomes}

\begin{itemize}

\item A complete set of measures of the prediction skills of each approach.

\item A method to estimate the parameters of an assimilative ecological model.

\item An understanding of the limitations of geostatistical models to predict
nonlinear dynamics. 

\item Propositions on how the statistical and dynamical approaches may
complement each other.

\end{itemize}
