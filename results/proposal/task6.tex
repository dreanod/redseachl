\section{Task 6: Improving an Ecological Model Data Assimilation Scheme through Statistical Predictive Models}

Duration: 3 months (by September 2015)

Submission: Journal of Geophysical Research 

Collaborator: George Triantafyllou / Boujeema

\section{Motivation}

In the previous task, we compared the forecasts of the ecological ERSEM model to that of the statistical models we developed from tasks 2 to 4. In this task we will study how these two approaches can be complementary. Specifically, we will study the use of statistical forecasts model to improve the forecasts of the ERSEM ecological model. The forecasts of the statistical models will be treated as observations, that can be assimilated by the filtering scheme used with the ERSEM model, and will give an improved forecast. When real observations will be available, they will be assimilated sequentially. This, method will allow the different ERSEM models on each cluster to communicate indirectly their states to one another. 

\subsection{Open Questions}

Can statistical predictive models be used to communicate information between deterministic model?
Would the access to information about other regions improve the model forecasts?
What are the global patterns of ecological dynamics in the Red Sea?

\subsection{Method}

Define new assimilation scheme
Define metrics to measure model improvement
Prepare training and test datasets
Train statistical model
Run simulation with assimilation of statistical observation
Compare with results of task 5

\subsection{Expected Outcomes}

An improvement in the prediction skills of the deterministic approach
A methodology to couple deterministic ecological models through statistical models
Insights on the global ecological dynamics of the Red Sea
